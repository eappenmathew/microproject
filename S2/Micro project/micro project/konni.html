			The State government has taken steps to include Konni in the tourism circuit of the Central Tourism Department by promoting the ecotourism initiatives taken up in the forest reaches of Adavi and Gavi in a big way.

The Departments of Forest and Tourism had started chalking out schemes to explore the tourism potential of Konni, Adavi, and Gavi by including these places in the tourism map of Kerala, said T. Pradeepkumar, Divisional Forest Officer. The departments would be launching attractive travel packages on the Konni-Adavi-Gavi route.

Forest Department sources said that the Central Tourism Department would include four circuits, including the Konni-Adavi-Gavi stretch, from Kerala in the Tourism Circuit. With this, the State would get Central assistance to the tune of Rs.8 crore for tourism development in the region.

Elephant camp
Mr. Pradeepkumar said the Elephant Camp at Konni had been identified as the eco-tourism hub in the region and steps would be taken to provide better amenities there. The park at the camp would be kept open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. A modern restaurant would be opened jointly by the departments.A herbal garden, bamboo park, arboretum, elephant breeding places in natural settings, honey bee park, and a butterfly park would be the other attractions at the Adavi ecotourism centre.
