Gavi - The eco-tourism experience

Drawing on the wild and natural beauty of the place, the State-run Kerala Forest Development Corporation has developed an eco-tourism project to attract more Nature lovers and adventure tourists to the place.  

It takes a two-hour journey by jeep from Kumily to reach picturesque Gavi which is blanketed by the greenery of tea plantations. Advance booking with the Kerala Forest Development Corporation is appreciated as entry passes have to be obtained from the forest check post en route at Vallakkadavu. 

Packages 
There are three different tour packages offered by the KFDC at Gavi.  The first is a day-time package from 8 am to 4.30 pm. The overnight package provides for accommodation at Green Mansions, the eco-tourism centre near the lake. In another overnight package, guests spend the night at a jungle camp site to which they are taken in jeeps. 

Ambience
The picturesque beauty of the place attracts a steady stream of visitors including deep jungle trekkers, bird watchers, Nature lovers, research students, and those looking for a break from the daily grind. The recently introduced eco-tourism project by the Kerala Forest Development Corporation provides a memorable wildlife and jungle experience. 

En-route Gavi
During the two-hour jeep ride to Gavi, one has to drive past hills, valleys, tropical forests, grasslands, sholas, gushing waterfalls and cardamom plantations. All along the way are beautiful places like  Mundakkayam, Kuttikkanam, Peerumedu and Vandiperiyar where one gets to see Nature at her best.
