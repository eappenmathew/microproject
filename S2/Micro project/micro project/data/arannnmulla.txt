The unique heritage village of Aranmula gets its name from the centuries-old Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple. The Parthasarathy Temple (dedicated to Sree Krishna) on the banks of the holy River Pamba attracts large crowds of devotees. The temple has fine murals from the 18th century.

The Vijnana Kalavedi at Aranmula imparts training in the traditional arts like Kathakali, classical dances, classical music, as well as Kalaripayattu. Foreign tourists stay here for long periods to get a first hand knowledge of the culture of Kerala. The famed Aranmula boat race is held on the last day of the week-long Onam festival.

Aranmula is also famous for its metal mirrors - Aranmula Kannadi, a unique craft which is not found anywhere else in the world.
